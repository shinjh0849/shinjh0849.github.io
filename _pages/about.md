I’m Jiho Shin, a postdoctoral research fellow (Queen’s University, from Sep 2025) and Ph.D. candidate at York University (2021–2025) working on AI/ML for Software Engineering—code generation, automated testing, and LLM-powered development workflows.

## Research focus

- AI for SE: agentic systems that synthesize and validate code, tests, and fixes from mined repository data.
- SE for AI: reliability, security, and evaluation of LLMs and ML/DL libraries.
- Benchmarks and metrics for test generation, vulnerability detection, and code intelligence tasks.

## Experience highlights

- **Queen’s University** — Postdoctoral Research Fellow; advising agentic SE studies (2025–present).
- **Turing** — RLEF/CodeGenAgent Lead; synthesized CoT code data and improved test-generation agents (2025).
- **HGS** — Applied AI Engineering Intern; built Copilot Studio chatbots for hiring and client guidance (2024–2025).
- **York University** — AI4SE & SE4AI researcher and head TA; automated testing/codegen and engineered reliable AI systems (2021–present).
- **Handong Global University** — Software Engineering researcher and TA; actionable defect prediction and codegen survey work (2019–2021).

## Education

- Ph.D., Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — York University (2021–2025). Thesis: LLM effectiveness in automated SE.
- M.Sc., Computer Science and Electrical Engineering — Handong Global University (2019–2021). Thesis: Actionable Defect Prediction.
- B.Sc., Computer Science and Electrical Engineering — Handong Global University (2012–2019); focus on web apps, HCI, and computer vision.
