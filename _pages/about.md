I’m Jiho, a product-focused engineer who enjoys turning ambiguous ideas into polished web experiences.

## Snapshot

- Currently experimenting with AI-assisted workflows, lightweight services, and delightful UI polish.
- Comfortable shipping across the stack: from data modeling and APIs to modern front-end frameworks.
- Drawn to teams where product, design, and engineering sit at the same table.

## What I’ve done

### Builder & engineer
- Shipped internal tools, marketing sites, and production-scale products across web and mobile.
- Championed observability, automated testing, and fast feedback loops to keep teams moving quickly.

### Collaborator
- Translate product narratives into actionable technical scopes.
- Facilitate async-first communication with docs, prototypes, and shared dashboards.

## Focus areas

| Area | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Web apps | React, TypeScript, Next.js, and design systems. |
| Back end | Node.js, Python, serverless functions, and lightweight Rails services. |
| Data & AI | Prompt design, evaluation harnesses, and analytics workflows. |
| Ops | GitHub Actions, IaC on AWS, and containerized dev environments. |

## Now

- Pairing with teams to stand up net-new ideas quickly.
- Writing short notes about experiments and lessons from the field.
- Always up for conversations about developer experience, product strategy, or coffee spots.
