This is a intentionally simple test page. If you can see it at `https://shinjh0849.github.io/test/` after pushing new changes, the deployment was successful.

## Checklist

- ✅ Page renders with the Minimal Mistakes layout.
- ✅ Navigation links update automatically thanks to `_data/navigation.yml`.
- ✅ Markdown, tables, callouts, and code blocks are parsed correctly.

## Sample content

### Table
