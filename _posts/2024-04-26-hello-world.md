Setting up this site with the Minimal Mistakes theme only takes a few steps:

1. Update `_config.yml` with your own name and links.
2. Drop Markdown files into `_pages/` for standalone content.
3. Write blog posts right here in `_posts/`.

Expect future posts to cover tiny experiments, notes on tooling, or anything else worth sharing.
