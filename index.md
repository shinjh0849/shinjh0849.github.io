I help teams go from sketch to shipped product quickly, then write about the process so it’s easy to repeat.

## What I’m focused on

- Product discovery loops that combine user interviews, analytics, and rapid prototyping.
- Tooling that lets small teams punch above their weight—developer environments, CI/CD, and observability.
- Practical AI integrations that augment workflows instead of replacing them.

## Current experiments

| Project | Theme | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launchpad | Product marketing | Testing interactive release pages powered by a shared CMS. |
| Opsboard | Support automation | Pairing LLM summaries with deterministic alert routing. |
| Velocity Kit | DX | Template repo to bootstrap new web ideas in under an hour. |
